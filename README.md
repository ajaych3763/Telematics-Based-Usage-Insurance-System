# Telematics-Based-Usage-Insurance-System
This project develops a basic Usage-Based Insurance (UBI) system that leverages telematics data and AI/ML to analyze driving behavior, calculate personalized risk scores, and provide actionable safety recommendations to drivers.

**Telematics Data Processing:** Ingests and preprocesses driving behavior data from telematics sources (or a simulated dataset based on real-world characteristics).  
**Driving Behavior Analysis:** Uses AI/ML techniques to identify specific driving behaviors like speeding, harsh braking, and sudden acceleration.  
**Risk Scoring:** Calculates a personalized risk score for each driver based on their driving behavior patterns.  
**Safety Recommendations:** Generates personalized feedback and recommendations to promote safer driving habits.
